## [0.4.1] - 2025-01-06

### Added

- **Model Registry Architecture** - Centralized single source of truth for all embedding models
  - New `ModelRegistry.ts` with complete model metadata (name, dimensions, provider, quality, description, installation, cost)
  - 38 comprehensive unit tests for ModelRegistry (all passing)
  - Helper functions: `getModelsByProvider()`, `getModelInfo()`, `getModelDimensions()`, `getAllModels()`, `modelExists()`, `getModelsByQuality()`, `getRecommendedModel()`
  - Partial string matching support for flexible model lookup (Ollama-style)

- **Enhanced Model Discoverability**
  - CLI `config` command now displays all 11 models organized by provider with dimensions and descriptions
  - Created `.claude-memory-config.example.json` - clean, copy-paste ready config example
  - Created `.claude-memory-config.example.jsonc` - comprehensive commented guide with inline model documentation
  - Both example files included in npm package distribution

- **Comprehensive Documentation**
  - New `docs/MODELS.md` - Complete guide to all embedding models
    - Decision matrix for choosing models
    - Quality tiers and performance benchmarks
    - Configuration examples for each provider
    - Migration guide for switching models
    - Advanced topics: custom models, multi-language support, performance considerations
  - Updated README with model discovery instructions

### Changed

- Refactored `OllamaEmbeddings.ts` to use ModelRegistry (eliminated hardcoded dimensions map)
- Refactored `TransformersEmbeddings.ts` to use ModelRegistry (eliminated hardcoded dimensions map)
- Refactored `OpenAIEmbeddings.ts` to use ModelRegistry (eliminated hardcoded dimensions map)
- Updated CLI `commands.ts` to dynamically generate model list from ModelRegistry (no more hardcoded output)

### Technical Details

- **DRY Principle Applied**: Eliminated 4 duplicate model dimension definitions across codebase
- **Improved `getRecommendedModel()` logic**: Now properly cascades through quality levels (highest → high → medium → low)
- **Empty string validation**: `getModelInfo()` now returns null for empty/whitespace-only model names
- **Quality-based filtering**: New `getModelsByQuality()` for finding models by quality tier
- All 147 tests passing (9 skipped), 0 warnings, 0 errors

## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-06

### Added

- **Merge Mode for Project Migration** - Combine conversations from different projects into one folder
  - `migrate_project` tool now supports `mode` parameter: "migrate" (default) or "merge"
  - "merge" mode combines conversations from source into existing target folder
  - Duplicate conversation IDs are skipped (target kept) - no data loss
  - Safely merge history from different projects or development branches
  - Automatic target database backup before merge
  - Transaction-based merge with rollback on error

### Changed

- `migrate_project` tool description updated to document both modes
- Tool handler generates mode-specific success messages

### Technical Details

- New `executeMerge()` method in `ProjectMigration` class
- New `mergeDatabase()` method uses `INSERT OR IGNORE` strategy
- Defensive table existence checking for schema compatibility
- 5 new comprehensive tests for merge mode (all passing)

## [0.3.0] - 2025-01-06

### Added

- **Project Migration Feature** - Recover conversation history when project directories are renamed or moved
  - `discover_old_conversations` tool - Automatically finds old conversation folders by scanning `~/.claude/projects/`
  - `migrate_project` tool - Safely migrates JSONL files and updates database paths
  - Combined discovery approach using database inspection, folder similarity scoring, and JSONL analysis
  - Dry-run mode for testing migrations without making changes
  - Automatic backups (`.claude-conversations-memory.db.bak`) before migration
  - Transaction-based database updates with rollback on error
  - Comprehensive error handling and validation

### Documentation

- Added migration section to README with step-by-step examples
- Created MIGRATION-TESTING.md with 6 test scenarios and troubleshooting guide
- Updated tool definitions with clear descriptions and parameter documentation

### Testing

- Added 39 new tests (24 unit + 5 integration + 10 tool handler tests)
- All 113 tests passing with 100% coverage for migration logic
- Test isolation ensures no interference with real conversation folders

### Technical Details

- New `ProjectMigration` class in `src/utils/ProjectMigration.ts`
- Scoring algorithm ranks folder matches: database path (100 pts) + folder similarity (50%) + JSONL count (30 pts max)
- Safe copy-based migration preserves original data
- Injectable `projectsDir` parameter for test isolation

## [0.2.5] - 2025-01-05

### Fixed

- Fixed MCP filtering to exclude messages instead of entire conversations
- Improved conversation filtering to prevent self-referential loops

### Changed

- Show indexed folders and database path in index response
- Better visibility into which folders were scanned

## [0.2.4] - 2025-01-04

### Fixed

- MCP conversation filtering improvements
- Removed debug logging

## [Previous Versions]

See git history for changes before v0.2.4.

## Migration Guide from 0.2.x to 0.3.0

No breaking changes. The migration feature is additive - all existing functionality remains unchanged.

To use the new migration feature:

1. Update to v0.3.0: `npm install -g claude-conversation-memory-mcp@0.3.0`
2. Restart Claude Code to load new tools
3. Use "Discover old conversations" when you rename a project
4. Use "Migrate from..." to copy history to new location

See README.md for detailed usage examples.
