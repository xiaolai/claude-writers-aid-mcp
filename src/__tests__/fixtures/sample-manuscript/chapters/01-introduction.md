## How to Use This Book

Each chapter builds on previous concepts. It's recommended to read sequentially, especially if you're new to web development. However, experienced developers may skip to specific chapters of interest.

See [Chapter 2](02-setup.md) for environment setup, and [Chapter 3](03-html-basics.md) for HTML fundamentals.
